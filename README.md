# Django_restful-framework
Drinks app - Django DRF API
Setup
Before you can run the Django DRF API project, you'll need to have Python and Django Rest Framework installed on your machine. You can install them using pip:
###pip install python
###pip install djangorestframework

Once you have Python and DRF installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

Running the App
To run the Django DRF API project, use the following command:
###python manage.py runserver

This will start the development server, and you can access the API by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Django Rest Framework
Django Rest Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It's built on top of Django and provides a set of tools and conventions for creating APIs that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile devices, and IoT devices.

In this project, we use DRF to create APIs for CRUD operations on an SQLite database. DRF provides a set of generic views and serializers that make it easy to build APIs quickly and efficiently.

SQLite Database
SQLite is a lightweight and portable database engine that can be easily integrated into web applications. It's a serverless database that stores data in a single file, making it easy to manage and backup.

In this project, we use an SQLite database to store data for our API. We define models in Django that map to database tables, and DRF provides serializers that can convert between Python objects and database records.

API Endpoints
The Django DRF API project includes the following API endpoints:

/drinks/: List of all drinks
/admin/: View admin page
/drinks/<int:id>/: To perform id specific GET, POST, PUT, DELETE actions through the api
Each endpoint supports the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for performing CRUD operations on the database.
